terminology:
  server computer runs web server
  forwarding computer runs synapse and ideally max (but not necessary)

1. create local network on forwarding computer
2. connect to local network from server computer
3. get the fresh IP address of the server computer — edit all network-config things to fit that IP
   dont forget to "make"
4. open synapse_heartbeat on each computer ** very important **
5. open synapse and make sure looks good on both computers
6. "node server.js" on server computer
7. "node forwarder.js" on forwarder computer — the logs should tell you if connected
8. open chrome localhost three js from server computer. lets do this.

to connect phone u gotta use sever_ip/8888:phone.html in safari


architecture:
  browser socket io.js -> kinect.js socket.io server -> maxer.js osc -> max msp
  forwarder connect socket -> kinect.js socket.io server -> browser socket io.js
  phone socket phone.js -> kinect.js socket.io server -> browser socket io.js
